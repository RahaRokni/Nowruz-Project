# Genius Music Platform
ðŸŽµ A Java-based music platform inspired by Genius.com ðŸŽµ

## Description
Built with **Java** using **OOP principles** (inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation).

# 1. Starting the App (Main Menu)
When you open the app, you see:

```
Welcome to our System!

Options:
1. Register new account  
2. Login  
3. View all users  
4. Exit  
5. Admin Login 
```
* **Register** â†’ Make a new account (as a listener or artist).
* **Login** â†’ Sign in if you already have an account.
* **View all users** â†’ See who else is using the app.
* **Admin Login** â†’ Only for the "boss" (admin) who approves artists.

## Registering an Account

If you pick **1. Register**, you fill in:

* **Name** (Your real name)

* **Age** (How old you are)

* **Username** (Your nickname in the app)

* **Email** (Must look like name@email.com)

* **Password** (Must be strong: uppercase, lowercase, number, and symbol)

Then, it asks:
**"Are you an artist? (y/n)"**

* if **(y)**
    * Your request goes to the **admin** for approval.

    * You canâ€™t upload songs until the admin says **"Yes!"**
    
* if **(n)**:

You become a **regular listener** and can start exploring music.


## Logging In
    
If you pick **2. Login**, you enter:

* **Username**

* **Password**

If correct, you go to your **personal menu** (different for listeners and artists).

## Regular User (Listener) Menu
Listeners see:

```
=== Regular User Menu ===  
1. Search content  
2. View followed artists  
3. View profile  
4. View top songs  
5. Comment on a song  
6. View comments  
7. Logout  
```
**What can listeners do?**
* âœ… Search for songs/artists â€“ Find music by name.
* âœ… Follow/unfollow artists â€“ Like subscribing to a singer.
* âœ… Comment on songs â€“ Write thoughts about a song.
* âœ… See top songs â€“ The most popular songs in the app.

## Artist Dashboard
If youâ€™re an **approved artist**, you see:

```
=== Artist Dashboard ===  
Welcome, [Your Name]!  
Followers: 100  
Albums: 2  
Total Songs: 10  
Total Streams: 5000  

Options:  
1. Add Album  
2. Add Single Song  
3. View Profile  
4. Logout  
```
**What can artists do?**
* ðŸŽ¤ **Add Albums** â€“ Group songs together (like a music book).
* ðŸŽµ **Add Singles** â€“ Upload one song at a time.
* ðŸ“Š **See stats** â€“ How many followers, streams, etc.

## Admin Controls (The "Boss")

Only the **admin** can:

* **Approve/reject artist requests** (like a manager deciding who gets to perform).

* **See all users** â€“ Check whoâ€™s registered.

**Admin Menu**
```
=== Admin Dashboard ===  
1. View artist requests  
2. View all users  
3. Logout   
```

* If someone wants to be an artist, the admin checks their details and says **"Yes"** or **"No"**.

# UserInfoRepository
* This is a repository class that handles storage/retrieval of user information

* It extends BaseRepository which provides common database operations

* Uses generics:

    * UserInfo - the type of objects it stores

    * String - the type of ID used (username in this case)
    
## Constructor
* When created, it:

    1. Calls parent class (BaseRepository) constructor

    2. Specifies the data will be stored in "userInfo.json" file

    3. Provides UserInfo.class so the repository knows what type of objects to work with

## getId() Method

* Overrides parent class method to specify how to get an object's ID

* For UserInfo objects, the ID is the username

* This helps the repository uniquely identify and locate users

## verifyArtist() Method

* Special method to verify artist accounts

* Steps:

    1. Finds user by username using findById()

    2. If user exists:

        * Sets their verified status to true

        * This likely enables special artist privileges

    3. If user doesn't exist, does nothing
    

## How It Would Be Used
1. When someone registers as an artist

2. Admin calls verifyArtist(username)

3. Repository:

    * Loads user data from JSON

    * Updates verification status

    * Saves back to JSON

4. Now the user has artist privileges

# ArtistRepository
